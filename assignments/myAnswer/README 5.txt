JavaFX_version: BlobDemo

1) Inside BlobDemo/src/blobdemo are my source code.

2) BlobDemo.java is the main activity to run

*** Because group is not a "undoable"/"redoable" command, therefore when you have a set of grouped blobs, clicking "undo" button won’t remove it from view since you cannot undo a group command. However, you can cut(control+x) to remove the group. I think that meets the requirement of this assignment.

I do not have too many documentation inside my code, because it’s hard to explain the geometry. If you want to know anything about how I do it, feel free to email me at hox294@mail.usask.ca

Thank you!
