Android_version: run LayoutSimulator.java


** Only part 1 runs properly.
** I have done a lot work for part 2 but it did not work due to the some issue in the onDraw() method, therefore I made them as comment inside the LayoutView.java class. Please check those work for part 2, including XWidget, XFrame, XButton classes. I wish I can have some credit for these effort.

Thank you very much!
